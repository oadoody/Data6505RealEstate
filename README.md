# Data6505RealEstate
Real Estate Final Project

# Objective:
  Our objective with this dataset was to help a family that is looking for a home in the US. We wanted to aid them in finding the best house for them at the lowest price.

# Data Source:
 The data set was found on Kaggle.com and is called "USA Real Estate Data". 900,000 listings were scraped from Realtor.com in order to compose this dataset. 

# Challenges 
  Although the dataset had 900,000 listings, many of them were duplicates which needed to be taken out. The dataset only have listings from 18 states. After we had removed duplicates some of these states only had one or a few listings. In order to increase the accuracy of our analysis we left these out so they would not skew our findings.
