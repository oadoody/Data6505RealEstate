 # Objective
  Our objective with this dataset was to help a family that is looking for a home in the NorthEast the US. We wanted to advise them in finding the best house for them at the lowest price.
  
 # The Client

Preferences of client:
   Traditional
   Price Range: Maximize the value of dollar to the home offerings
    Looking for most acrerage, bed/bath, price/sqft value possible to compell relocation

# Process of Our Analysis
-Gathering sufficient data

-Cleaning the data and missing values

-Doing initial analysis to gauge the depth of our data's ability

-Further the analysis to find a recommendation

-Give our client recommended listing
# Data Source
 The data set was found on Kaggle.com and is called "USA Real Estate Data"
 900,000 listings were scraped from Realtor.com in order to compose this dataset. 
 You can find the Kaggle page [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset?select=realtor-data.csv).

# Challenges 
  Although the dataset had 900,000 listings, many of them were duplicates which needed to be taken out. The dataset only have listings from 18 states. After we had removed duplicates some of these states only had one or a few listings. In order to increase the accuracy of our analysis we left these out so they would not skew our findings, leaving our group with a narrowed selection of states all commonly in the NorthEast.
